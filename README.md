# Silent Error: Undefined Variable in innerHTML

This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML/JavaScript bug related to using an undefined variable within the `innerHTML` property. The issue doesn't produce a typical error message but results in unexpected behavior (likely a blank div or no change). 

The `bug.html` file showcases the incorrect code, while `solution.html` provides the corrected version.  This bug highlights the importance of properly defining and checking variables before using them in DOM manipulation.
